# Civil Servant

## Overview
**Civil Servant** is a modular API gateway built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Gateway. It is designed to dynamically discover, register, and proxy services, enabling seamless integration of new services while providing a central access point.

## Features
- **Dynamic Service Discovery**: Automatically discovers services with `service-config.json` files in a designated directory.
- **Service Registration**: Registers services dynamically and proxies requests to them.
- **Route Management**: Automatically configures routes based on service descriptors.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend functionality by adding new services or enhancing the gateway logic.
- **Environment Variable and Configuration Support**: Services can include their own configuration and setup scripts.

## Application Information
- **Name**: Civil Servant
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Author**: @ilgigante77
- **Website**: [https://github.com/tanadelgigante/civil-servant](https://github.com/tanadelgigante/civil-servant)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- Python 3.9+ for services like Calibre API

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/civil-servant.git
    cd civil-servant
    ```

2. **Build the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Create the services directory**:
    Create a `services/` directory in the project root. Each service should have its own subdirectory with a `service-config.json` file and optional `setup.sh` script.

### Configuration

1. **Define Routes and Services**:
   Ensure each service directory contains a `service-config.json` with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "sample-api",
      "language": "python",
      "route": "/sample-api",
      "startCommand": "your_startu√®_command_here"
    }
    ```

2. **Service Setup**:
   Each service directory can include a `setup.sh` script to prepare its environment (e.g., install dependencies).

3. **Application Configuration**:
   Update `application.yml` as needed to customize gateway routes or application settings:
    ```yaml
    server:
      port: 8187

    logging:
      level:
        root: INFO
        com.tanadelgigante: DEBUG

    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: sample-api
              uri: http://127.0.0.1:8000
              predicates:
                - Path=/sample-api/**
              filters:
                - StripPrefix=1
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

2. **Using Docker**:
   Create a `Dockerfile` for the gateway:
    ```dockerfile
    
		FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk as build
		WORKDIR /app
		COPY .mvn/ .mvn/
		COPY mvnw .
		COPY pom.xml .
		COPY src ./src
		RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests
		RUN ls -l /app/target 		
		
		FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre
		WORKDIR /app
		COPY --from=build /app/target/civilservant*.jar app.jar
		VOLUME /config
		ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar", "--spring.config.location=/config/application.yml"]
    ```

   Build and run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker build -t civil-servant .
    docker run -p 8187:8187 civil-servant
    ```

3. **Service Execution**:
   - Ensure services have valid configurations and scripts.
   - The gateway will automatically discover and start services using their `startCommand`.

### Usage

#### API Endpoints
- **Health Check**:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8187/test
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Civil Servant Gateway is working!"
    }
    ```

- **Proxy Requests**:
    - Example: Access the Calibre API:
      ```bash
      curl -X GET http://localhost:8187/sample-api/endpoint?api_token=your_32_char_token
      ```

### Debugging

- Use the application logs to monitor service registration and route configuration. Look for `[INFO]` and `[DEBUG]` messages in the console output.
- To debug individual services, check their logs during startup.
